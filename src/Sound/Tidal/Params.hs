{- | a pattern of numbers from 0 to 1. Skips the beginning of each sample, e.g. `0.25` to cut off the first quarter from each sample.

Using `begin "-1"` combined with `cut "-1"` means that when the sample cuts itself it will begin playback from where the previous one left off, so it will sound like one seamless sample. This allows you to apply a synth param across a long sample in a way similar to `chop`:

@
cps 0.5

d1 $ sound "breaks125*8" # unit "c" # begin "-1" # cut "-1" # coarse "1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128"
@

This will play the `breaks125` sample and apply the changing `coarse` parameter over the sample. Compare to:

@
d1 $ (chop 8 $ sounds "breaks125") # unit "c" # coarse "1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128"
@

which performs a similar effect, but due to differences in implementation sounds different.

In the style of classic drum-machines, `cut` will stop a playing sample as soon as another samples with in same cutgroup is to be played.

An example would be an open hi-hat followed by a closed one, essentially muting the open.

@
d1 $ stack [
  sound "bd",
  sound "~ [~ [ho:2 hc/2]]" # cut "1"
  ]
@

This will mute the open hi-hat every second cycle when the closed one is played.

Using `cut` with negative values will only cut the same sample. This is useful to cut very long samples

@
d1 $ sound "[bev, [ho:3](3,8)]" # cut "-1"
@

Using `cut "0"` is effectively _no_ cutgroup.
